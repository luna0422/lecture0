		<p>Once upon a time there was a wonderful sea on the border areas
			of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The sea was fed by
			two rich streams; the Amu Darja from the South and the Sir Darja from the East.
			It's area was 68.000 square kilometers, and with that, was it the world's fourth
			biggest salt lake.</p>
		<p>The sea had a unique, rich wildlife. 30.000 people menaged to make a 
			livelihood from fishing on that sea and by working in the
			related processing industry. It's water was sailed by 113 fishing boats
			and it gave the Sovjet Union, 1/6 of their fish production.</p>
